            Didn't do much today.

            I'm thinking about getting an VR headset as they're trendy at the moment. I want to get ready for summer when we go camping. Never owned one so I want to give it a try. Maybe get some excercise. It's not cheap though. The one I want is 500 quid. Do I need it? Hell no. Do I want it and will I get it? Probably so. haha. I may as well spend it before I find another thing that's more expensive and more attractive.

            Till next time.

            Quiet night and a quiet day so far. Not too many meetings today so I can actually get some stuff done. Woke up early meaning I get a longer morning coffee zen moment. I did wake up early to the sounds of garbage trucks because it's pickup day but it's all good. Doing my normal morning routine. Get up, feel the muscle aches from the workout the day before and wobble to the kitchen to make coffee.

            Yesterday's gym session was good. I tried lifting heavier. We did side planks with dips, arm presses (I think that's what they're called), and something they called 21 bicep curls (7 full, 7 bottom 1/2 only, and 7 top 1/2 only). Cardio in between stations. I'm still aching from the last session though.
