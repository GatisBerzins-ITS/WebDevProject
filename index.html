                    Hello! My name is Gatis Berzins and this is my Personal Blog! Here I'll be talking about anything that happens to me that I'm willing to share to the general public.
                    I hope you enjoy my content. Thanks in advance :)

                    Just a simple introductory note from me : I was born in Latvia on the 6th of December in 2002.I moved around a bit when I was younger(Lived in Ireland for a year)
                <br>
                <br>
                    I am a full time student doing a Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Computing at Institute of Technology Sligo. I am hoping to get a job as an Engineer at a network provider such as Vodafone or Virgin Media if possible, as they pay very well.
                <br>
